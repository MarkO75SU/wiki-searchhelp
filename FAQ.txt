## 2. Features & Functionality

*   **Q: How does the "All these words" field work?**
    *   A: Entering terms in the "All these words" field means all of them must be present in the search results (equivalent to an implicit AND).

*   **Q: What's the difference between "All these words" and "Exact Phrase"?**
    *   A: "All these words" requires each word to be present, but not necessarily together. "Exact Phrase" requires the sequence of words to appear together, enclosed in quotation marks.

*   **Q: How can I exclude specific words from my search?**
    *   A: Use the "Without these words" field. Enter the words you wish to exclude, and pages containing any of these words will not be returned.

*   **Q: How do I search within a specific category?**
    *   A: You can use the "In Category" field to specify one or more categories. For subcategories, use the "Deep Category" field.

*   **Q: What are Namespaces?**
    *   A: Namespaces are different areas within Wikipedia (e.g., Articles, Files, Categories, Help pages). You can select specific namespaces to narrow down your search results.

*   **Q: How does the new category dropdown work?**
    *   A: The "Category" dropdown allows you to select a predefined Wikipedia category (e.g., Science, History) to pre-fill the "In Category" search parameter. This helps quickly target broad subject areas.

## 3. Troubleshooting & Support

*   **Q: I entered my search parameters, but the "Generated Search String" is empty.**
    *   A: Ensure you have entered at least one search term in the primary fields like "All these words" or "Exact Phrase".

*   **Q: The search results seem incomplete or incorrect.**
    *   A: Double-check your entered parameters. Wikipedia's search syntax can be complex. Refer to the official Wikipedia search help link for detailed information on how parameters work. Using specific parameter combinations (like `intitle:` vs. `intext:`) can significantly affect results.

*   **Q: How do I report a bug or suggest a new feature for WikiGUI?**
    *   A: Please refer to the project's repository (if available) for issue tracking, or contact the developer via [mention contact method if available, e.g., GitHub issues page].
